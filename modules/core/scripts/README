Data load script
================

This script is used to load large collections of works into Elog.io. Make sure
the catalog database is running and start it like following:

    node load.js --userId 54051c3d21595b8a2e228b9a package.txt

Other available options are:

* --verbose: Print progress messages as works are created;
* --private: Create private works;
* --format: Collection format. The only format supported at the moment is "datapackage",
  described in the [Elog.io documentation](https://github.com/commonsmachinery/catalog/blob/master/doc/datapackage.md);
* --ownerOrg ID of the organisation who owns the works.
